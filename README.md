# Natural Language to T-SQL
This project leverages the power of Semantic Kernel and the Azure OpenAI service to translate a user's request for specific data to an actual SQL query. This query is automatically executed to retrieve the associated data.

# Coming here from the Visug talk?
This repo will be used to further develop the NL2SQL project. The demos and slides I used during the Visug talk can be found [here](https://github.com/stijn-castelyns/Visug-Semantic-Kernel-Demos).

## Interested in knowing more about Semantic Kernel and modern AI Application development?
I work at a training company called [U2U](https://www.u2u.be) where I teach courses related to (amongst other topics) Azure AI development. If you want to keep up to date with the most recent techniques/design patterns related to AI powered Application development, check out our course [Developing Intelligent Solutions with Azure AI Services](https://www.u2u.be/training/microsoft-ai-development).
